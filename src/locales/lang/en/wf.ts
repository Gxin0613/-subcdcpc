If this field is `0`, the process is sent to the second node.\n   - **ToEmps**：This is the list of people who need to receive the process, with multiple recipients separated by commas. If this field is empty, no recipient is specified. For example: `zhangsan,lisi`.\n   - **Paras**：This is the form data, i.e. the content of the form to be loaded. The name of the form field in the start node must match the parameter name for the system to automatically assign a value to it.For example: `@XingMing=Zhang San@Addr=Jinan, Shandong@Tel=186xxxxxxxxx`.Explanation: A process can be started successfully if the form in the start node contains these fields.\n   - **TaskSta**：This is the status field, which defaults to `0` (indicating no startup). On successful startup, the value of this field changes to `1`; on failed startup, it changes to `2`. The startup message is automatically written to the `Msg` field.\n   - **Msg**：This is the content of the message written after the process is automatically initiated.\n   - **StartRDT**：This is the date on which the process will be started. If this field is empty, the process will start as soon as the timed task starts.\n   - **RDT**：This is the date it was sent.。\n  #### Configuration\n   - **service activation**：To ensure that this works automatically, **must** configure a timed task in your server to start ccbpm's process service scripts at regular intervals\n   - **Windows Timed Tasks**：Check [operation manual](https://gitee.com/opencc/JFlow/wikis/pages/preview?sort_id=3678116&doc_id=31094)\n   - **Linux Timed Tasks**：Check [operation manual](https://gitee.com/opencc/JFlow/wikis/pages/preview?sort_id=12691557&doc_id=31094)\n  #### illustrative\n  - The first record has been activated successfully.\n  - The second record is waiting to be activated.\n  ![Trigger activation](./resource/WF/Admin/AttrFlow/AutoStart/Img/WF_Task.png trigger-activated.png)  \n'}",

            '\n  ####  API\n\n  #### Login and Portal API\n 1. Start with code integration and organizational integration.\n 2. Next, at the login screen of your own system, you have to execute the ccbpm framework login after a successful login.\n 3. The so-called login is a call to ccbpm login interface, as shown in the code on the left.\n\n<pre>\n// The following code needs to be written after your system validation password and username.\nstring userNo = "zhangsan";\nBP.WF.Dev2Interface.Port_Login(userNo);\n</pre>\n\n#### Menu\n\n1. initiation: work that can be initiated by an operator\n\n2. Pending: work awaiting processing.\n\n3. In transit: a process in which I am involved, but which has not yet been concluded.\n\n4. Cc: Work that does not need to be handled by me, but needs to be known to me.\n\n  ##### Initiate:\n\n<pre>\n//Get a list of processes that can be initiated by a specified person, call this interface to return a datatable, you can refer to a demo to realize the output of the initiation list.\nSystem.Data.DataTable dtStart = BP.WF.Dev2Interface.DB_GenerCanStartFlowsOfDataTable("zhangsan");\n</pre>\n\n  ##### To-do：\n\n<pre>\n//Get the specified person pending , call this interface to return a datatable, you can refer to a demo to realize the output of the initiation list .\nDataTable dtTodolist = BP.WF.Dev2Interface.DB_GenerEmpWorksOfDataTable();\n</pre>\n  ##### On the way：\n\n<pre>\n//Get the in-transit of the specified person, call this interface to return a datatable , code reference:.\nDataTable dtRuning = BP.WF.Dev2Interface.DB_GenerRuning();\n</pre>\n\n  ##### Query：\n\n<pre>\n//ccbpm provides you with a link, you can call this link, you can also go according to the code to realize.For n implementation of the list output code, see.\n Running Demo: <a href=\'\'>query</a>\n</pre>\n\n#### Create WorkID\n\n1. Creating a job ID is the beginning of the initiation process.\n\n2. ccbpm job ID is an Int64-bit integer that is always generated according to the serial number + 1.\n\n3. this workid is globally unique and has no duplicates. this information is logged to Sys_Serial. the WorkID generation starts at 100.\n\n4. this workid is globally unique and has no duplicates. this information is logged to Sys_Serial and WorkID generation starts at 100.\n  \n<pre>\n//Pass in the process number and the call creates a job ID.\nInt64 workid = BP.WF. Dev2Interface.Node_CreateBlankWork("001");\n</pre>\n\n#### Send - Simple Send\n\n1. job sending is to make the node move downward.\n\n2. The call to the interface executes the send and returns an object of the execution result, which is a variable in the execution of the process engine.\n\n3. Parsing this variable allows you to check whether the process is complete, which node it has run to, and who can handle the work at the next node?\n\n4. It flows and is executed according to the rules of the process design.\n\n5. Its recipient, which is determined in accordance with the rules of the recipient.\n\n<pre>\n//Pass in the process number, and the WorkID is sent.\nBP.WF.SendReturnObjs objs= BP.WF.Dev2Interface.Node_SendWork("001",workid);\n\n// Is the checking process over?\nbool isFlowOver = objs.IsStopFlow;\n\n// Getting sent to that node?\nint toNodeID = objs.VarToNodeID;\nstring toNodeName = objs.VarToNodeName;\n\n// Get to whom it was sent?

To which node? (Universal send interface)\n\n1. This interface can be called if the programmer knows who to send to next and to that node.\n2. The interface then gets rid of the direction condition rules and acceptor rules designed by the process engine.\n<pre>\n//If the node to be reached in the next step is determined (or calculated by yourself), the recipient of the next step, can be called in the following format.\nBP.WF.SendReturnObjs objs = null; objs = BP.WF.Dev2Interface.Node_SendWork("001", workid, 103, "zhangsan" );\n//Send to one person, if sending to more than one person separate them with commas e.g.. zhangsan,lisi,wangwu\n\n//The following call is made in such a way that it knows that it is to be sent to that node, but does not know to whom it is to be sent, and lets the recipient rules defined by the current node determine it.\nobjs = BP.WF.Dev2Interface.Node_SendWork("001", workid, 103, null);\n\n//The following call is made in such a way that it is known to be sent to those people, but not to that node, letting the current node-defined direction condition determine it.\nobjs = BP.WF.Dev2Interface.Node_SendWork("001", workid, 103,"zhangsan");\n\n// Outputs a message, which can be prompted to the operator.\nstring infoMsg = objs.ToMsgOfHtml();\n</pre>\n#### Revoke\n\n1. Undo is the reverse of send.\n2. Undo can be accomplished by calling the undo window provided by ccbpm, which is the easiest way.\n3. Address: /WF/WorkOpt/UnSend.htm Parameters: FK_Flow,FK_Node,WorkID,FID, 4 parameters of the current flow.\n4. If you need to work on other devices, or to write a handover interface of your own, refer to.\n5. The ability to be revoked is determined by the revocation rules of the currently active node.\n6. The undo function is displayed in the list of processes that are in transit, and only work that is in transit can be undone.\n7. Work in transit: as the name implies, work in which I am involved and which has not yet been completed.\n8. A rollback process is one that needs to be repeated at a specified node at the end of the process for a specified person to go down the line from new.\n<pre>\n/*\n* performs an undo and returns information about whether the undo was successful or not, if an exception is thrown it means that the undo failed.\n* Revocation fails for a variety of reasons, most likely because the currently active node does not allow revocation rules to dictate it.\n*/\n\nstring msg= BP.WF.Dev2Interface.Flow_DoUnSend( workID);\n</pre>\n\n#### Roll back\n\n1. Rollback differs from undo in that rollback is done after the process is complete and rollback is done by an administrator.\n2. A rollback process is one that needs to be repeated at a specified node at the end of the process for a specified person to go down from new.\n<pre>\n//Performs a rollback, returns information about the rollback execution, and throws an exception if the rollback fails.\nstring msg= BP.WF.Dev2Interface.Flow_DoRebackWorkFlow("001", workID, 103, "Because of an approval error, you need to roll back and restart the approval from node 103.") ;\n</pre>\n#### Go back\n1. Returns can be accomplished by calling the return window provided by ccbpm, which is the easiest way.\n2. Address: /WF/WorkOpt/ReturnWork.htm Parameters: FK_Flow,FK_Node,WorkID,FID, 4 parameters of the current flow.\n3. If you need to work on other devices, or if you want to write your own return interface, refer to.\n<pre>\n/*\n* 1, gets the nodes to which the current node can be returned, and the interface returns a datatable.\n* 2, the ability of a node to fall back to that write node is determined by the fallback rule of the current node.\n* 3, the call to return takes three parameters: node number, job ID, process ID, and for linear processes FID is always equal to zero.\n*/\nSystem.Data.DataTable dtCanReturnNodes = BP.WF.Dev2Interface.DB_GenerWillReturnNodes(103, workid, 0);\n\n// Returns a node that can be returned.\n\n//performs a return, the current node is 103 and the node to be returned is 105.\nstring msg = BP.WF.Dev2Interface.Node_ReturnWork("001", workid, 0, 103, 105, "Your application information is incomplete, please revise and resend.", false);\n</pre>\n#### Handover \n\n1. Handover can also be accomplished by calling the handover window provided by ccbpm, which is the easiest way.\n2. Address: /WF/WorkOpt/Shift.htm Parameters: FK_Flow,FK_Node,WorkID,FID, 4 major parameters of the current flow.\n3. Referral is the handing over of work to be done by oneself to someone else.\n4. If you need to work on other devices, or to write a handover interface of your own, refer to.\n<pre>\n/*\n* Calls the handover interface, passing in the necessary parameters to perform the handover.\n* FID is always equal to 0 on a linear process.\n*/\n\nBP.WF.Dev2Interface.Node_Shift("001", 103, workid, 0, "zhangsan", "As I need to travel, I am hereby handing over my work to you.");\n\n/*\n* Withdrawal of transfers\n* If after the handover, it is realized that the handover is not needed, it needs to be revoked back, calling the revoke handover interface.\n*/\nBP.WF.Dev2Interface.Node_ShiftUn("001", workid);\n</pre>\n#### Additional signature\n\n1. countersigning can also be accomplished by calling the countersign window provided by ccbpm, which is the easiest way.\n2. Address: /WF/WorkOpt/Shift.htm Parameters: FK_Flow,FK_Node,WorkID,FID, 4 parameters of the current flow.\n3. To countersign is to refer the work you want to do to someone else, or to let someone else handle it.\n4. There are two modes of countersigning: 1, countersigning is sent to the next node by the countersigner.2, After countersigning, the countersigner sends it to the current person, who sends it to the next node.\n5. If you need to work on other devices, or if you want to write your own countersign interface, refer to.\n<pre>\n/*\n* Calls the countersign interface, passing in the necessary parameters for execution.\n* FID is always equal to 0 on a linear process.\n*/\n\n//technician zhangsan accepts the job and clicks send will also send it to the current person, who will send it to the next node.\nstring info1= BP.WF.Dev2Interface.Node_Askfor(workid, BP.WF.AskforHelpSta.AfterDealSendByWorker, "zhangsan", "We need a technical opinion from you.");\n\n//The technician fills it out and sends it directly to the next node.\nstring info2 = BP.WF.Dev2Interface.Node_Askfor(workid, BP.WF.AskforHelpSta.AfterDealSend, "zhangsan", "We need a technical opinion from you.");\n\n//The technician replies with a countersign, before being sent by the current person to the next node.\nstring infoReply = BP.WF.Dev2Interface.Node_AskforReply("001", 103, workid,0, "I have issued a technical opinion, please refer to it.");\n</pre>\n#### Closing process\n\n1. There are three ways in which a process can be terminated\n2. The first goes to the last node ending normally.\n3. The second is at a specific node where the user needs to terminate the process for downward movement (as opposed to a deletion process).\n4. the third at a specific node where the user needs to delete the process.\n<pre>\n/* *  \n* Manual termination of the process, which is logged.\n*/\nstring overInfo = BP.WF.Dev2Interface .Flow_DoFlowOver( workID, "That supplier can not be found, to close out the process.");\n/* * Deletion process,\n* The deletion process can be invoked in a variety of ways, depending on the user needs.\n* The last parameter is whether to delete the subprocess.\n*/\n\n//Follow the markup deletion process\nstring delInfo0 = BP.WF.Dev2Interface .Flow_DoDeleteFlowByFlag( workID, "I don not need a vacation anymore.", true);\n\n//Thorough deletion process with no logging.\nstring delInfo1 = BP.WF.Dev2Interface .Flow_DoDeleteFlowByReal( workID, "I don not need a vacation anymore.", true);\n\n//Thorough deletion process with logging.\nstring delInfo2 = BP.WF.Dev2Interface .Flow_DoDeleteFlowByWriteLog("001", workID, "I don not need a vacation anymore.", true);\n</pre>\n  ##### Encapsulated WebServices interfaces\n1. ccbpm interface API is a set of static methods that can be encapsulated into various forms such as: microservices, webservices, interfaces, controllers, and so on.\n\n2. Now take the classic commonly used webservice encapsulated as an api as an example.\n\n3. ![img](http://localhost:2296/WF/Admin/AttrFlow/APICode1.png)\n\n\n  ##### Interface package\n\n  ![img](http://localhost:2296/WF/Admin/AttrFlow/APICode3.png)\n\n  ##### Invoke a method\n  ![img](http://localhost:2296/WF/Admin/AttrFlow/APICode2.png)\n',

          _key34:
            '\n #### Definition \n - Embedding a form in mode is a practice where the developer customises a form and then binds the address of the form to a node property. \n - This mode is where the system runs with a toolbar in the header and an audit component in the tail. \n - A developer-defined page has a Save() function that is triggered when the user clicks the [Save] button or [Send] button on the toolbar outside the frame. \n - you need to complete the data integrity validation and data saving in the Save() function, or call the ccbpm interface to pass parameters into the process engine. \n - This method: return true if the save succeeds, return false if the save fails. Used to verify the integrity of the data filled in. For example: when the user performs a send, first perform a save, after the save succeeds perform a send, after the save fails, prevent the send. \n - The Url you enter can have parameters, but the system will attach all the parameters to the url. \n - e.g.:/SDKFlowDemo/QingJia/SDKQianRuFangShiForm.htm (it may also be the routing page of vue /src/App/Demo/VueSelfFrm/QingJia.vue. e.g. http://localhost:3000/#/ QingJia)\n - e.g.: the url you configured is http://xxxx:222:/abc.htm The actual Url of the system is http://xxxx:222:/abc.htm?FK_Flow=xxx&FK_Node=xxx&WorkID=xxx&UserNo=xxx& Token=xxx\n - The system will pass the variables and parameters in the current process environment to your custom page, you can display, save data according to these parameters, control data read-only, editable. \n #### Working Schematic Diagram \n - Header: Toolbar, Tail: Audit Component, Middle Department Customised url.\n - Diagram: \n !

[Embed Mode Forms] (. /resource/WF/Admin/AttrNode/FrmSln/SelfFrm/SelfFrmUrl.png "Embedded Mode Form.") \n\n #### How do I write parameters to the process engine? \n - During the running of a process, you need to write parameters to the process engine to control: direction of the process to turn, and recipients etc. \n - ccbpm provides two ways to do this: \n 1. by calling the API interface in the save method. \n 2.

It differs from cc in that cc can run down the line without reading it, but he must process it to run down the line. \n - The usual mode of collaboration is that more than one person has to click on the send function button to confirm that they have processed it, that they agree with it or recognize it. \n',

This n people are processed in a set order of precedence, and at the same point in time one person must be pending, invisible to the others. \n - Often such a pattern is also used with the review component, where each person expresses their opinion in order and then it is sent to the next node. \n - When returning, the first person returns to the previous node, and the others return in order. \n - an official document sent to a department, the department under the n people can be accepted (note that this is a node), in accordance with the domestic administrative system, these n people will be from the smallest arrived in a queue, there is the smallest level of staff for approval, and then in turn, go to the end of the last person by the last person sent to the next node to go. These n people are the processors of the node, the n people review steps are determined by their order, so when setting up the recipients of the node, in order to perform. \n',

For example: if the current node is a sampling node, and the sampling group has 1 leader and n members, only when the leader sends it down the line will the job be marked as complete. \n - Third: There are n leaders/team leaders, n>=1 Any leader/team leader sends down to mark the process as complete. For example: the sampling task of the current node is given to two sampling groups to be responsible for, there are two group leaders n members, any leader sends down to mark that job finished. \n\n\n',

          '\n #### Help \n - Every time before creating a new document, through the ccbpm interface, according to the template number to generate a WorkID as the primary key of the document. \n - When designing the main table of the form, it is recommended to use OID as the primary key, which can be varchar(20), used to store the primary key of the form. \n - When opening a form from the Initiate, Pending, In Transit, Completed pages. \n - When opening a form from the Initiate, Pending, In-transit, Completed pages, the system passes in xxxx.htm?WorkID=xxx&FK_Node=xxxx to open the form. \n - We call such a schema a WorkID as primary key schema form because the primary key of the form is generated by the process template number with the current user information. \n\n ### Form Development Requirements \n 1. Accept the parameter passed by WorkID=xxx for extracting the form data and rendering it. \n 2. Accepts the parameter NodeID=xxx, which is used to determine whether the elements of the form are read-only or hidden. \n 2. There must be a Save() method in the form. \n 1. For vue add a toolbar component to the header and footer of the form, and a WorkCheck audit component. \n 1. for html form need to add toolbar,workcheck markup, please refer to demo.\n\n #### if your business system and ccbpm is database merged. \n 1. Set the primary key of the form as OID, set varchar(30), as the primary key. \n 1. Turn on the process properties to make the business table of the process consistent with the table settings of the form. \n 1. When the process is running, the system will automatically extend the table to automatically add the automatic fields of the process. \n 1. For example: OID, WFState, Title, FlowEndNode, Emps, FlowStarter, FlowStartRDT. .... \n \n #### If the two databases are not merged. \n 1. You can get the process operation information by querying the OID, which is associated with the process engine registry WF_GenerWorkFlow. \n 1. You can write the process information to the document table through events, such as: before node send event, end of process event. \n\n #### Application Scenarios \n 1. The built-in form used in ccbpm cannot meet the requirements and a customized form is needed. \n 1. A newly created form. \n',

          '\n #### Help \n - The addition, deletion, modification and checking of documents has already been done through your own system, each document has its own primary key (usually called the document number) \n - The developer expects to use ccbpm to flow a single row of a list of documents (a single document) through a process. \n - For example: there is a list of news items with an approval button on the right side of each item, which initiates the approval process for the posting of the news item. \n - We call such a schema a Customized Primary Key Schema form, because the primary key for this form is generated by our own schema. \n #### Primary Key Parameter\n - The primary key parameter that opens a document page, e.g.: /XXX/BuyBill.vue?DJBH=xxxxx\n - DJBH is the primary key parameter. \n - Definition: The name of the parameter that opens the document form with the primary key ID is called the primary key parameter. \n #### Initiating a Process Call\n - When initiating a process, the developer needs to pass the primary key parameter into the workflow processor. /WF/MyFlow.vue?FK_Flow=001&DJBH=xxxx \n - ccbpm will then go to your customized url page, for example: /XXX/BuyBill.vue?DJBH=xxxxx&WorkID=xxx&FK_Node=111&UserNo=xxx&Token =xxx\n - Open your bill. \n #### Pending Calls\n - The system automatically passes the primary key parameters to you without the need for developer processing. \n\n ### Form Development Requirements \n 1. Accepts NodeID=xxx parameter for determining read-only, hidden elements of the form. \n 1. There must be a Save() method in the form. \n 1. For vue add toolbar components to the header and footer of the form, and a WorkCheck audit component. \n 1. for html form need to add toolbar, workcheck markup, please refer to the demo for details.\n\n #### Application Scenarios \n - Historical forms are too costly to revamp, you can keep the data structure unchanged while using on ccbpm.\n - \n\n',

Accept the parameter passed by WorkID=xxx for extracting the form data and rendering it. \n 2. Accepts the parameter NodeID=xxx, which is used to determine whether the elements of the form are read-only or hidden. \n 2. There must be a Save() method in the form. \n 1. For vue add a toolbar component to the header and footer of the form, and a WorkCheck audit component. \n 1. for html form need to add toolbar,workcheck markup, please refer to demo.\n\n #### if your business system and ccbpm is database merged. \n 1. Set the primary key of the form as OID, set varchar(30), as the primary key. \n 1. Turn on the process properties to make the business table of the process consistent with the table settings of the form. \n 1. When the process is running, the system will automatically extend the table to automatically add the automatic fields of the process. \n 1. For example: OID, WFState, Title, FlowEndNode, Emps, FlowStarter, FlowStartRDT. .... \n \n #### If the two databases are not merged. \n 1. You can get the process operation information by querying the OID, which is associated with the process engine registry WF_GenerWorkFlow. \n 1. You can write the process information to the document table through events, such as: before node send event, end of process event. \n\n #### Application Scenarios \n 1. The built-in form used in ccbpm cannot meet the requirements and a customized form is needed. \n 1. A newly created form. \n',

Accepts NodeID=xxx parameter for determining read-only, hidden elements of the form. \n 1. There must be a Save() method in the form. \n 1. For vue add toolbar components to the header and footer of the form, and a WorkCheck audit component. \n 1. for html form need to add toolbar, workcheck markup, please refer to the demo for details.\n\n #### Application Scenarios \n - Historical forms are too costly to revamp, you can keep the data structure unchanged while using on ccbpm.\n - \n\n',
